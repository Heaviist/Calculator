# Calculator
The Odin Project's calculator

# Assignment
Create a calculator using everything we've learned so far about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project will combine alle the knowledge and skills we have been working on so far.

# Goal
Make sure the program incorporates all the listed requirements so we end up with a working calculator. Basic steps are given, implementation is up to me.

# Expected challenges
The following are points I expect to be challenging:
- clearing data entered but keeping all the data up to that point
- making sure the clear all button properly clear everything without breaking the program
- making sure the display is properly updates every time
- stringin together operations flawlessly
- making sure the screen doesn't overflow
- as CSS/design never feels like my main thing, I do feel like I'm at least slightly getting the hang of it. It could probably be fun to make this kinda look nice
- extra credit backspace/keyboard seem very challenging, don't see an obvious solution but will try.

# Results and evaluation
